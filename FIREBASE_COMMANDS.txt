# Quick Firebase Setup Commands

## Run these commands in order:

# 1. Install Firebase CLI (if not already installed)
npm install -g firebase-tools

# 2. Login to Firebase
firebase login

# 3. Install FlutterFire CLI
dart pub global activate flutterfire_cli

# 4. Configure Firebase for this project
cd "C:\Users\Glen Umadhay\OneDrive\Desktop\LostAndFoundFlutter"
flutterfire configure

# 5. After configuration, change demoMode to false in:
# lib/config/demo_config.dart
# Change: static const bool demoMode = false;

# 6. Run the app
flutter run -d chrome

## Firebase Console Tasks:
# Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com/

# Enable these services:
# 1. Authentication → Email/Password
# 2. Firestore Database → Create database (Test mode)
# 3. Storage → Get started (Test mode)

## That's it! Your app will now use Firebase instead of mock data.
